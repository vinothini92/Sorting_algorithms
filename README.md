Sorting_algorithms
==================

Implementation of Various sorting algorithms in python


Given sorted list-A and another sorted list-B.Sort the both list to get A+B sorted list

solution:
since the both the list are sorted already,Bubble sort and insertion sort works fine.
complexity for both algorithms when given list sorted is
number of comparisions-O(n)
number of exchanges-O(1) 
in bubble sort it needs extra temporary variable to exchanges whereas in 
insertion sort it can be done with varaibles and it reduces number of exchanges.
insertion sort works better for this problem.
